## Snapshot
- **Current phase:** P0 — Foundations & Spikes (IN PROGRESS)
- **Current milestone:** P0 offline four-service Docker stack (implemented; partially verified — image builds/browser env-blocked; commit pending approval)
- **Overall completion:** repo + frozen contract + simulator + sim→Mosquitto→backend→WS(ASGI) + React consumer + offline compose stack (real Dockerfiles) done; E2E latency spike + gate close-out (full `up --build` on a normal machine) + hardware spikes pending
- **Repository:** github.com/Yeshwanth-lb/SHTAPM (branch `main`; M1 d841404 … M3.5 8483283; CI-repair fab702b pushed & CI green; offline-stack uncommitted)

## Completed
- Requirements + design docs authored (`docs/` — PRD, TRD, App Flow, Aurora UI/UX, Backend Schema, Impl Plan).
- `CLAUDE.md` project instructions committed.
- Git repo initialized and pushed to GitHub.
- PRD ↔ Doc06 phase conflict identified and reconciled (see `DECISIONS.md` D001/D002).
- Reconciled implementation roadmap agreed (PRD phase authority; Doc06 = detailed task/test spec mapped into PRD phases).
- Project-state / handoff files created and committed (30b03ee).
- **P0 Milestone 1** (committed d841404) — monorepo skeleton (TRD §02.6); docker-compose (mosquitto+db functional, backend+frontend wired-empty behind `app` profile); `.env.example`; Python + frontend lint/test tooling + CI + pre-commit skeleton; self-hosted font foundation; `.gitignore` hardened; READMEs.
- **P0 Milestone 2** (committed e1f2e4a) — froze the canonical telemetry/decision/ledger contract per **D007** (Doc05 §05.8 authoritative). Pydantic v2 models in `backend/app/schemas/contracts.py`, mirrored TS in `frontend/src/types/contracts.ts`, accept/reject tests.
- **P0 Milestone 3.1** (committed 0b1c4dd) — hardware-free telemetry simulator in top-level `simulator/` (D005/D008): deterministic generator emitting the frozen contract + MQTT publisher to `shtapm/{device_id}/telemetry`. Fixed root pytest wiring so the whole suite runs in one command.
- **P0 Milestone 3.2** (committed aa1563c) — connected simulator → Mosquitto → subscriber verifier. Real round trip verified against `eclipse-mosquitto:2.0`.
- **P0 Milestone 3.3** (committed 4c578c5) — backend MQTT telemetry ingestion: consumer + `TelemetryStore` + FastAPI lifespan + `/healthz`.
- **P0 Milestone 3.4** (committed 728838f) — backend WebSocket fan-out: `app/ws/{frames,broadcaster,routes}.py` + consumer `add_sink` seam; `/ws` Doc05 §05.8 frames.
- **P0 Milestone 3.5** (uncommitted) — minimal React consumer: `frontend/src/{App,main}.tsx`, `hooks/useTelemetryWebSocket.ts`, `features/telemetry/TelemetryView.tsx`, `lib/ws.ts` + RTL tests; `scripts/ws_smoke.mjs`. Reuses frozen TS contract, plain React state, capped-backoff reconnect. MQTT→backend live-verified under uvicorn; WS-serving-to-client + RTL/build gated to CI (sandbox blocks — see below).

## In progress
- P0 offline stack implemented + partially verified; awaiting approval to commit/push. Image builds + browser render close out on CI / a normal machine.

## Next
- E2E latency spike/harness; P0 gate close-out = full `docker compose up --build` (all four) on a normal machine + browser render + go/no-go.

## Environment gates (honest — sandbox limits, not code failures)
- **Docker image builds** (backend `pip`, frontend `npm`) fail cert-verify inside the build (gateway MITMs TLS; base images lack its CA). So the full four-service `up` can't be built here. Dockerfiles are standard/correct — no insecure workarounds added; they build on CI / a normal machine (frontend build already green in CI).
- Real uvicorn **WS serving to an external client** returns HTTP 403 in this sandbox (localhost `Upgrade` interception); app-level WS proven via Starlette TestClient (M3.4). Works under normal serving/CI.
- `npm install` blocked locally → no lockfile; RTL/`tsc`/`vite build` verified in CI.
- To verify the full stack + browser render, run on a machine without the TLS interception:
  `cp .env.example .env` → set `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` → `docker compose up --build` → open `http://localhost:5173`, `curl http://localhost:8000/healthz`, and run the host simulator (README).
- Note: integration tests need a broker + paho-mqtt; they self-skip otherwise. Backend runtime now needs fastapi/paho (`backend/requirements.txt`); tests need httpx (dev extra). Docker daemon started to verify; quit Docker Desktop if unwanted.
- P0 gate: clean offline `docker compose up` + go/no-go.
- Hardware spikes (sensor/interface reads, INA219, on-Pi LSTM+IF timing) stay **hardware-blocked** until a Pi/rig is available (`TODO.md`).

## Contract authority (frozen — read before touching any message)
- **D007:** Doc05 §05.8 is authoritative for wire field names/shapes. Full channel names; flat `isolated[]`/`substituted[]`; ledger keeps `payload_hash`; `type` is a WS-envelope concern only (MQTT payloads omit it). Canonical Python = `backend/app/schemas/contracts.py`; TS mirror MUST stay in sync.
- **U14:** `…/command` inject payload is unspecified — do not invent; blocks P4 injection.

## Standing caveats (honest state)
- Fonts (M1): foundation only — woff2 binaries + `@fontsource` pin deferred to P5.
- Local tooling gaps in this env: linters (ruff/black/eslint) and TypeScript are NOT installed; npm is blocked by a TLS/proxy cert error. Python tests run via an isolated venv; ruff/black/eslint/tsc/vitest execute in CI. Do not claim they ran locally.
- `docker compose config` validated; full `docker compose up` on a clean machine not yet run (P0 gate, later milestone).

## Known blockers
Blocking questions are tracked in the roadmap discussion; the ones that gate *code* (not yet resolved — DO NOT silently assume):
- P2: Beta-reputation trust-update formula + recovery dynamics UNDECIDED (weights exist in schema, math does not).
- P2: fault-vs-attack physics/correlation attribution rules + thresholds UNDECIDED.
- P2/P7: SWaT/WADI dataset access UNCONFIRMED (fallback: TEP + bench).
- P3: LSTM — one shared model or two (prognosis vs digital-twin)? UNDECIDED (edge stores single `lstm.pt`).
- P3: digital-twin training-data source UNDECIDED.
- P3: `divergence_threshold` + substitution uncertainty-cap values UNDECIDED (schema column, no default).
- P3: RL reward shaping + acceptable false-isolation rate UNDECIDED.
None of these block P0.

## Hardware availability / dependencies
- Development environment currently has **no Raspberry Pi and no bench rig** attached.
- Hardware-free: P0 scaffolding, P2 (ML on recorded/dataset), P3 (models/logic), P4 (backend), P5 (dashboard), P7 (evaluation).
- Requires Pi + rig: P1 physical acquisition; P3 physical safe-stop / dry-run / <500ms edge timing; P6 live §18.4 run + physical chaos tests.
- Mitigation: telemetry simulator/replay source (D005) stands in for the rig for all non-physical work and is the demo fallback (PRD R1/R2).

## Architecture constraints (non-negotiable)
- Edge safety loop `sense→detect→attribute→decide→heal→actuate` runs entirely on the Pi; **never depends on backend/cloud/network** (D003).
- Backend = read/observe + advisory-control plane only (visualization, history, config, audit, advisory commands). Never in the safety path.
- One **frozen shared data contract** (telemetry/decision/ledger) identical across firmware, simulator, backend, DB, WebSocket, TS types (D006). No component invents field names.
- Ledger = SHA-256 hash chain; Hyperledger is future scope (D004).
- Offline-demo golden rule: whole stack runs on one machine via `docker-compose`, no internet, fonts self-hosted.
- Aurora aesthetic is subordinate to the 1 Hz live stream + <2s sensor→UI + <500ms self-heal budgets; effects auto-downgrade before the data path (TRD §02.9).
- Tech stack frozen by TRD §02.2 (changes require a version bump + a DECISIONS.md entry).
